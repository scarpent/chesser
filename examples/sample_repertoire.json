If White wants to develop some pieces, the most important square they control by playing 1.e4 is, in fact, the e4 square itself: as long as there’s a White pawn on e4, there can’t be a Black pawn on e4, which means White’s g1-knight can be developed to f3 without fear of getting kicked away by a pawn and losing a tempo.\n\nBlack has several ways to respond. The main idea is to find a way to prevent White from achieving or maintaining a two-pawn center with both e4 and d4. They may try to:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Control the d4 square.</li>\n  <li>Attack White’s e4 pawn directly.</li>\n  <li>Prepare to establish their own pawn on d5.</li>\n  <li>Let White build a center but prepare to undermine it later.</li>\n</ul>",

It also fights for control of the center.\n\n1.e4 directly controls d5 and f5. If White wants to develop some pieces, the most important square they control by playing 1.e4 is, in fact, the e4 square itself: as long as there’s a White pawn on e4, there can’t be a Black pawn on e4, which means White’s g1-knight can be developed to f3 without fear of getting kicked away by a pawn and losing a tempo.\n\nBlack has several ways to respond. The main idea is to find a way to prevent White from achieving or maintaining a two-pawn center with both e4 and d4. They may try to:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Control the d4 square.</li>\n  <li>Attack White’s e4 pawn directly.</li>\n  <li>Prepare to establish their own pawn on d5.</li>\n  <li>Let White build a center but prepare to undermine it later.</li>\n</ul>",

A more aggressive player might also go for the King’s Gambit with (2.f4). Black can take the pawn, but the gambit might allow White a quick and dangerous tactical attack. The former world chess champion, Bobby Fischer gave several great demonstrations of that opening’s deadly potential.\n\nBlack will want to be familiar with 2.Qh5, where White dreams of checkmating Black with a quick Scholar’s Mate.

Wherever the <code>Review</code> button appears, it always takes you to the current “Next Review Due”. {(Most likely not the variation you're looking at.)} It's meant to let you quickly start or resume a review session at any time.\n\n<i>View UI Elements</i>\n\nThe interface is intentionally somewhat dense.
