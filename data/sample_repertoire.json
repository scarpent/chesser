If White wants to develop some pieces, the most important square they control by playing 1.e4 is, in fact, the e4 square itself: as long as there's a White pawn on e4, there can't be a Black pawn on e4, which means White's g1-knight can be developed to f3 without fear of getting kicked away by a pawn and losing a tempo.\n\nBlack has several ways to respond. The main idea is to find a way to prevent White from achieving or maintaining a two-pawn center with both e4 and d4.

If White wants to develop some pieces, the most important square they control by playing 1.e4 is, in fact, the e4 square itself: as long as there's a White pawn on e4, there can't be a Black pawn on e4, which means White's g1-knight can be developed to f3 without fear of getting kicked away by a pawn and losing a tempo.\n\nBlack has several ways to respond. The main idea is to find a way to prevent White from achieving or maintaining a two-pawn center with both e4 and d4. They may try to:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Control the d4 square.</li>\n  <li>Attack White's e4 pawn directly.</li>\n  <li>Prepare to establish their own pawn on d5.</li>\n  <li>Let White build a center but prepare to undermine it later.</li>\n</ul>\n\n{<i>(<a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess_Opening_Theory/1._e4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See more in Wikibooks...</a>)</i>}",

A more aggressive player might also go for the King's Gambit with (2.f4). Black can take the pawn, but the gambit might allow White a quick and dangerous tactical attack.
