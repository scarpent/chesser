It also fights for control of the center.\n\n1.e4 directly controls d5 and f5. If White wants to develop some pieces, the most important square they control by playing 1.e4 is, in fact, the e4 square itself: as long as there's a White pawn on e4, there can't be a Black pawn on e4, which means White's g1-knight can be developed to f3 without fear of getting kicked away by a pawn and losing a tempo.\n\nBlack has several ways to respond. The main idea is to find a way to prevent White from achieving or maintaining a two-pawn center with both e4 and d4. They may try to:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Control the d4 square.</li>\n  <li>Attack White's e4 pawn directly.</li>\n  <li>Prepare to establish their own pawn on d5.</li>\n  <li>Let White build a center but prepare to undermine it later.</li>\n</ul>\n\n{<i>(<a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess_Opening_Theory/1._e4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See more in Wikibooks...</a>)</i>}",

            "text": "1...e5 serves to challenge White's plan of having the center squares to themselves. Of course, just like White's e4 move, e5 opens up the diagonals for Black's Bishop and Queen. While the position is still symmetrical there are few limits to where White can take the game next.\n\nThe most common move is (2.Nf3), continuing the fight for the center. A more aggressive player might also go for the King's Gambit with (2.f4). Black can take the pawn, but the gambit might allow White a quick and dangerous tactical attack. The former world chess champion, Bobby Fischer gave several great demonstrations of that opening's deadly potential.\n\nBlack will want to be familiar with 2.Qh5, where White dreams of checkmating Black with a quick Scholar's Mate.

This is because there is usually only one good square for the knight, while the bishop has several options. We can see this in Black's most common response, Nc6.
