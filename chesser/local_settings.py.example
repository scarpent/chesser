"""
Optional instance-specific overrides for Chesser.

Copy this file to `local_settings.py` to override settings without editing the
committed settings modules. Despite the name, `local_settings.py` can be used
in any environment (development, demo, staging, or production) and is
intentionally not committed to source control.

This is especially useful for forks: keep your customizations in one private
file and minimize merge conflicts when pulling upstream changes.

Deployment notes:
- `local_settings.py` is ignored by git by default (see `.gitignore`).
- If you deploy via git and want this file included, you must remove it from
  `.gitignore` or commit it explicitly.
- Prefer environment variables for hosted/production deployments.
- Avoid overriding security-sensitive settings here (e.g. SECRET_KEY, DEBUG,
  ALLOWED_HOSTS) unless you fully understand the implications.
